## 👨‍💻 Design 
Kecal, a fork of Instrument Sans, has been thoughtfully redesigned as a versatile, open-source alternative to commercial system fonts. The typeface is now more condensed with bolder regular, features certain stylistic sets enabled by default, and open terminals, modern letterforms for improved readability.
